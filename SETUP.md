# Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
   - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here`
3. Start the dev server:
   - `npm run dev`

Note: This sample uses the OpenAI API key directly in the browser for a simple
demo experience. For production, route requests through your own backend.
